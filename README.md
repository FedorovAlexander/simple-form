# SimpleForm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.2.

## Description

This is a simple form built using the Angular framework, designed to demonstrate basic form handling and API integration. The form is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with validation and error handling.

The form collects user input and makes a mock API call using the [dummyJson.com](https://dummyjson.com/docs/auth) service for authentication. You can use any user's credentials from the [list](https://dummyjson.com/users).

Valid credentials examples:

- username: `emilys`, password: `emilyspass`
- username: `michaelw`, password: `michaelwpass`
